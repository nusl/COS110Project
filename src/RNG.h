 *	type() returns an unsigned int that is used to seed the RNG
 *	The type is established polymorphically by random() being called in the leaf classes of the hierarchy.
 *	This way, seeding behaviour and responsibility is self-encapsulated.
 *	If a class wants to make use of the random number generator, 
 *	the programmer needs to add that class to the list of types in the type() function.
 *	The type() function will throw a domain error if an unregistered class is attempting to use rand().
